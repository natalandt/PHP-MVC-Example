# PHP-MVC-Example

Cut and dried basic php MVC. No classes yet added to extend base classes (Model, View, and Controller). 

**Yet to add:**
- Prefer db connection to be singular and access to tables to be OO based
- Proper .htaccess file for redirecting all URLs to the main index.php in ROOT

## Installation

Once fully up to date, simply copy this project to a working Apache web server with PHP. Will update this for fun. Feel free to use as a starting point. You will also need to setup and create a mySQL db with tables with the schema used in the code.
